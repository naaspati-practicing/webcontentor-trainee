The main idea here is that instead of having a property to bind to directly, you bind
the input to the setter method, which stores the real value on a private property so you
can protect it from direct access. The setter method is also where you can run any vali-
dation logic. Then you use the getter method to return the value of the private property
anytime itâ€™s requested.
